Demonstrates two-way bindings with a single input field. The implementation is as follows:
1. The **index.html** is the entry-point to the app.
2. The `DOMContentLoaded` event triggers **app.js**.
3. The **app.js** imports classes `Observable`, `Computed` and method `bind2DOM` from **Bindings.js**.
The implementation included a `setTimeout()` to pause execution for demonstration.

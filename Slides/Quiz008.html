        Thoughts bubble up in the mind. Our likes or dislikes
        give rise to feelings. But the mind itself has arisen
        like a wave cresting on the surface of ocean.
        So many waves are arising and falling all the time
        on the surface of the ocean. That ocean of existence
        is our true nature called <em>brahman</em>.

        Rising above the duality takes skill. The skill to shift perception
        from events to existence. Attachment to the experience of events 
        diminishes awareness. Being centered on awareness diminishes 
        the agitation of events. The thorn has lodged in the body 
        causing irritation. It must be skillfully extricated, mere rubbing
        will only cause it to lodge in deeper.

        Skill is needed to quiet the mind and go deep into oneself, 
        to avoid chewing on an experience, cogitating over it
        in the mind long after the event has passed. Events arise
        like bubbles out of changeless existence and dissipate 
        back in it. The Sanskrit word for bubble is <em>budbuda</em>. 
        Experiences pass like than the foamy bubbles tossed on a wave. 
        <br><br>
        <em>Taranga phena budbuda</em>. Wave, foam, bubble.

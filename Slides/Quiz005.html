    <p>We associate with identifying characteristics that
        limit our conception of abilities in ourselves and others.
        These characteristics are as follows:
        <em>gender</em>, that is male or female,    
        <em>age</em>, that is junior or senior,
        <input type="text" id="response" data-binding="response">,
        that is skill-level in a pursuit or vocation, from novice to expert,
        <em>status</em>, that is social standing, whether high or low. 
    </p>

        These identifying characteristics create fixed conceptions, 
        confining one's awareness to the realm of perceptual experiences,
        giving rise to opposites that stir likes and dislikes.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Gender</b>, whether male or female. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Age</b>, whether junior or senior.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Talent</b>, whether novice or expert. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Status</b>, whether respected or scorned.
            </li>
        </ol>
        The perceptual shift from <em>doing</em> to <em>happening</em> 
        breaks the pattern, yielding freedom. The one consciousness 
        out of which action arises also gives rise to experiences 
        of suffering and enjoyment. Seeming opposites are complementary, 
        or we would have neither day nor night, neither hot nor cold, 
        neither war nor peace.Each arises in time as events unfold 
        and this acknowledgement brings calm.
        <br><br>
        <em>"I am the doer!"</em> The concept is like the bite of a dark serpent, 
        whose venom has seeped into every fiber of our being. 
        It is like stirring muddy water vigorously with a stick
        in the hope that doing so will make it clear and calm.
        Awareness is swept up in perceptual experiences. In meditation, 
        awareness blossoms and is centered on the boundless, formless self, 
        untouched by transient events on the periphery.
        <br><br>
        Let the fire of this knowledge burn all ignorance.

        The crux of the matter is mistaking the impermanent for permanent.
        The physical body itself is changing. The lining of the stomach
        is renewed as fast as two days. The cells that make up the skin
        are replaced every two to three weeks. White blood cells can last
        from a few days to a little over a week. Red blood cells last 
        for about four months.

        Thoughts change. Emotions and moods change, the experience of
        an incessant stream of events. The experience of change implies 
        a reference point. This is the unchanging, untarnished self. 
        There are seven levels of existence. We can unpack this knowledge
        by analogy to a computer as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Body</b>, the physical body, is like the hardware.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Breath</b>, the lifeline, is like the electricity that powers on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mind</b> is like the Operating System, makes the hardware function as a computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Intellect</b> is the programs like spreadheet software, word processor, 
                email and web browser, that make the computer useful.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory</b> is the impressions created when programs run. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ego</b> is the self-awareness. Here, the analogy runs out as a computer is not self-aware.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Self</b> that which the awareness is about.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>

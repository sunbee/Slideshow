        Worrying is the mind stuck like a gramophone needle in a groove.
        How to drop the worries? There are many ways. Each way represents 
        a unique way to acknowledge the ever-changing nature of experience. 
        By practicing the technique, one can manoeuver more easily.
        <br><br>
        See the futility in the worry. We are a speck in the Universe.
        <br><br>
        Blow it up to outsized proportion. It becomes funny.
        <br><br>
        Look back in time at the worries then that are stale now. Remember 
        the worries of the past. We overcame those worries. 
        <br><br>
        Kriya is da bomb! Stops the chattering mind. Doesn't allow any mind
        to exist, so how can worries exist in the mind! Done correctly.
        <br><br>
        Accept that everything belongs to you.
        <br><br>
        Act enlightened.
        <br><br>
        Skill is needed to quiet the mind and go deep into oneself. 
        To avoid chewing on an experience, cogitating over it
        in the mind long after the event has passed. Events arise
        like bubbles out of changeless existence and dissipate 
        back in it. The Sanskrit word for bubble is <em>budbuda</em>. 
        Skillfully observe experiences pass like the foamy bubbles 
        tossed on a wave. 
        <br><br>
        <em>Taranga phena budbuda</em>. Wave, foam, bubble.

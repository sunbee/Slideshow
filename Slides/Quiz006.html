        A traveller passing by a forest in the dark night 
        saw a snake on the path in the feeble light of a lantern.
        Petrified, he stood rooted to the spot for hours, 
        until the truth was revealed by light of dawn. 
        The traveller laughed at his own foolishness.
        The forest, once dark and intimidating, burst forth
        with the cadence of life. Birds sang, peacocks danced, 
        streams flowed.

        Events that seem bothersome become play with dawning knowledge
        of their impermament nature. Emotions flow and ebb in cycles.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Sahasrara</b>, the crown of the head, home of bliss. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Anjana</b>, the temples, center of anger and awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Vishuddha</b>, the throat, center of grief and gratitude. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Anahata</b>, the heart, center of lover, fear and hate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Manipura</b>, the solar plexus, center of joy and jealousy, greed and generosity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Swadishthana</b>, the genitals, center of creativity and lust.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Muladhara</b>, the anus, center of inertia and enthusiasm.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Anger descends into grief, grief descends into fear and hate, which in turn
        yield to greed and jealousy, giving way to lust that brings about inertia.
        Inertia flips over to enthusiasm, triggering creativity, giving rise to joy 
        and generosity, ascending to love, expanding awareness and attaining bliss. 
        These cycles continue and the mind mistakenly attaches thoughts and moods
        to people and events, developing strong likes and dislikes, that reinforce
        the associations in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
        <br><br>
        But the self is untouched and undivided by these disturbances on the periphery.
        Like a film that is exposed over and over to impressions, the restless mind
        bears a jumbled image that occludes the self. The mind that is calm and free 
        of stress is possessed of clarity and at one with untainted self.
        Remove the husk and the rice is already present inside. It is a game of dropping.
        <br><br>
        Sadhana, body of practices like <em>kriya</em>, erases impressions and concepts 
        that overshadow the self drop away. The peace and perfection that is our very nature
        is revealed in glimpses. The guru shows us our highest possibility.
        <br><br>
        You are peace!

        The five elements, earth, water, fire, air and ether, reign over the mind in turn, 
        giving rise to different moods and sensations.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Earth</b>: Feeling of groundedness or a heavy feeling. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fire</b>: Feeling of feverishness or anger.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Air</b>: Flightiness, feeling of movement. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Water</b>: Feeling connected, sense of flowing or floating.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ether</b>: Love, fear, feeling totally at ease or totally discomfitted.
            </li>
        </ol>
        To identify with these elements is to be embroiled in their drama. 
        Observing the state of mind, one sees that none of the elements has a permanent station. 
        Each one dominates in turn, arising and then yielding to another.
        Ignorance of this phenomenon means identifyif .. resist, persist.. fly escapes room, control, .. they bind us or we vind them
        <br></br>
        Freedom.. witnessing what is happening .. any states of mind is temporary.. pure consciousness unstained by stream of events,
        pure like the space... when ths becomes well-founded, bondage breaks. Thisi s ppossible right now.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Shama</b>: Forgive yourself to let go the past. 
                Whatever impressions past events have left, 
                without forgiveness, how will we move past them?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Arjava</b>: Sincerity is required to move on, once free of the past. 
                Otherwise, forgiveness becomes license to keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
                That leads nowhere. forgiveness is the kindling. Sincerity lights the fire.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Daya</b>: Don't be hard on the self or the other. 
                Recognize the difference between <em>daya</em> and <em>ahmimsa</em>. 
                <em>Daya</em>, compassion, is inclusive and obliterates the difference between self and other.
                <em>Ahmimsa</em>, non-violence, sets up the self versus the other. 
                Without compassion, there is anger and harshness of conduct.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dosha</b>: What follows compassion is contentment.
                A frustrated person cannot be compassionate,
                towards self or any other. We have set tracks for people
                and we want people to walk those tracks. 
                When a friend or lover springs a surprise, we take affront. 
                Recognize that not one of us will be around for much longer.
                We look at people and events as we want them to be,
                rarely as they are. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Satya</b>: Recognize the impermanence of the body. 
                The body is always changing. And people around us are changing,
                as events flow in a frenzied stream like a swollen river. 
                Change is the only constant. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        These five principles are the <b>golden keys</b>. The right time to apply them is now. 
        Life becomes a pursuit of the unattainable. Wherever we find ourselves, 
        we immediately start looking for what comes next. Scratch an itch
        and that only increases the desire to scratch. 
        <br><br>
        Contentment is not antithetical to creativity, it is the mother of creativity!
        The occasional frustration is part of life, like salt is a part of food,
        and adds flavor to the nourishment. To think that frustration fuels creativity 
        is like partaking of salt for food.
        <br><br>
        To imbibe the nectar, there is no better time than now! Nurture these qualities, 
        nourish them.

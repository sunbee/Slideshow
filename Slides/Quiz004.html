        The five elements, earth, water, fire, air and ether, reign over the mind in turn, 
        giving rise to different moods and sensations.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Earth</b>: Feeling of groundedness or a heavy feeling. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fire</b>: Feeling of feverishness or anger.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Air</b>: Flightiness, feeling of movement. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Water</b>: Feeling connected, sense of flowing or floating.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ether</b>: Love, fear, feeling totally at ease or totally discomfitted.
            </li>
        </ol>
        To identify with these elements is to be embroiled in their drama. 
        Observing the state of mind, one sees that none of the elements has 
        a permanent station. They arise in turn, dominating for a while before
        yielding to another. 
        <br></br>
        Ignorance of this phenomenon means mistaking the impermanent for the permanent.
        The fly that wandered into the living room now looks to depart,
        but the commotion we create over her presence only detains her longer. 
        Seeking to exert control over the elements, we are needlessly enmeshed.
        That which we resist, persists.
        <br><br>
        Bearing witness to what is happening sets us free. Any state of mind is temporary.
        The pure consciousness is unstained by the stream of events. Like space is 
        untainted by events unfolding in it, arising and vacating in their time, 
        we are pure. When this becomes well-founded, bondage breaks.
        <br><br>
        This is possible right now!
